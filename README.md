# 🚀 Express Server Application — SBA318

**Course Project** • Node.js & Express Fundamentals

This project is a backend server application built using **Node.js and Express**. It demonstrates core backend concepts including RESTful routing, middleware usage, template rendering, and server–client interaction through HTML forms.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Create a server application with Node.js and Express
- Build a RESTful API using Express routes
- Create and use custom Express middleware
- Render views using a template engine
- Handle user input through HTML forms
- Interact with a self-made API from the frontend

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This application represents my introduction to **server-side JavaScript**.  
Rather than manipulating the DOM directly, this project focuses on:

- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Structuring backend logic
- Managing application flow with middleware
- Separating frontend views from backend logic
